# Tests

For the high-bandwith version of the app we are using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), which is and end-to-end (e2e) testing library but also allows unit testing.

The e2e tests examples are on the cypress/integration folder and the unit tests under cypress/unit.

## How to run the tests

To open the cypress GUI use

```bash
yarn high cypress:open
```

or for the unit tests

```bash
yarn high cypress:unit:open
```

Also you can run the tests on headless mode with the following commands:

```bash
yarn high cypress:run
```

and

```bash
yarn high cypress:unit:run
```

You can find two example tests on:

- cypress/intgration/sidebar.spec.js tests for some user case selecting one preset on the sidebar.
- cypress/unit/layer-group-reducers.spec.js test a layer group reducer to be sure that it has updated a layer correctly.
