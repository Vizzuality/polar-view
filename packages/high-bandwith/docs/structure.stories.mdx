# State Management

For the state management we are using [https://redux.js.org/](redux) with the [https://redux-toolkit.js.org/](redux-toolkit) library.

## 1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

create a `.env.local` at the root of the app. You can copy `.env.sample`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOW_BANDWITH_URL="https://polar-view.vercel.app/"

```

## 2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn high dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/antarctic.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

There are no [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) on this project. But they could be created as a middleware for some API.

## 3. DEVELOPMENT

Once you installed all the dependencies and packages you will be able to run these commands available in `package.json` by using `yarn high dev`, `yarn high build` or `yarn high start`

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs next build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server
