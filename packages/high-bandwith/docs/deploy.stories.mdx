# Deploy

The deploy process is done on Vercel. This is an automated deploy that takes directly the github repository and deploys it to the Vercel server.
The deployment is done in three different instances (high-bandwith, low-bandwith and storybook).
The environment variables of production and the configuration is managed on the vercel config online.
